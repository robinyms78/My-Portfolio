# My-Portfolio

My portfolio contains the main projects and exercises which I have developed.

The exercises are divided into 3 main groups, namely Python code, Java code and C++ code.

The projects are divided into 4 main groups, namely Python code, Objective-C code, Java code and C code.

The projects within each group are as follows:

1. Python Code:

   a. Customer walking simulator: A desktop application which provides a graphical user interface to simulate customer movement as a substitute for the vision system for the robot controller.
   
   b. Head motion synchronization system: An API to synchronize the head motion in the communicative process between human and robot using reactive and interactive model.
   
   c. Machine learning system: An API to classify the data set using supervised and unsupervised learning and compare the performance of each model.
   
   d. Marketing system: A desktop application to reveal customer daily and monthly order and visit patterns based on customer's data using MySQL.
   
   e. Remote education system: A desktop application to control Pepper's movement in the classroom using motion planning and control, head motion synchronization between human and Nao robot using the camera and OpenCV, and a robot tutoring system using Webot and Microsoft Speech Engine.
   
   f. Weather information collection system: A weather information collector system based on Open weather map API to detect weather condition and output weather-related speech for the robot controller. 
   
   g. Topic modelling system: An API to extract topic models from a given data set using Latent Diriclet Allocation with Gibb's sampling.  

2. Objective-C Code:

   a. Library recommendation system: An iPhone application to enable user to borrow and return books, a barcode scanning system and geographical information system for book return.

3. Java Code:

   a. Deals and event recommendation system: An Android application which provides a graphical user interface and geographical information system to enable the user to search for deals and events based on his present geographical location. 
   
   b. Tourist recommendation system: A desktop application to provide recommendations to tourist of attractions in Singapore using rule-based reasoning in C language integrated production system(CLIPS).
   
   c. Tutoring system: A robot tutoring system which comprises of a sensory system to detect students' emotion in C++, a reasoning system to select lesson content in Java and an attention system to manage robot's teaching based on student's internal and external state in CLIPS.

4. C Code:

   a. Car light controller system: A simulator to simulate car lighting control system using finite state machine.
   
   b. Potentiometer: An embedded system to control the LED and LCD on ARMS microcontroller using rate monotonic scheduling and earliest deadline first scheduling.
